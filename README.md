## The Gaussian & Maximum Entropy

This repository contains the following program(s):

- `HW13/CLT.x` : Script for generating a visualization of the
                 manifestation of the central limit theorem
                 as the number of observations averaged per
                 sample is increased. See result [here](https://i.ibb.co/mG7qTZn/CLT.png). Inspired by 
                 [this graphic](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Limit_Theorem.png). [C++]

### Requirements

In order to compile (by typing `make`) and run the C++ examples, you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

### Usage

The executable can be called from the command line.
